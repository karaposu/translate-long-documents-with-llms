### Long Text Translation Tool

This tool is designed to handle translation tasks for long texts, addressing several key challenges:

- **Correct Chunking**: Ensures the text is divided into appropriate chunks for seamless translation without cutting off sentences or important context.
  
- **Context-Aware and Stable Translation**: Maintains the meaning and coherence of individual chunks, ensuring that context from surrounding text is considered for accurate translation.
  
- **Speed Optimization**: Focuses on enhancing the translation speed without sacrificing quality or accuracy, even for large volumes of text.
  
- **Consistency and Hierarchical Formatting**: Preserves the structure and formatting across different chunks, ensuring a unified and well-organized output.

This task is also used to test the implementation of the `llmservice` framework, which helps assess chunking, translation stability, and performance in long text scenarios.
